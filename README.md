# Medicinal_Plants_Detection_By_Using_Deep_Learning_Model

Description of the project - 
Designed and implemented an AI-driven web application capable of identifying medicinal plants from leaf images using YOLOv8 model. The system, developed in Python and integrated with an HTML/CSS frontend, enables users to upload plant images and instantly receive accurate classifications along with their medicinal properties. This project combines deep learning with a user-friendly interface to make traditional plant knowledge more accessible and reliable.
